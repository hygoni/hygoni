## My contributions to linux kernel
[See on linux-next](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=42.hyeyoo%40gmail.com)

I like working with the community. I'm not yet fully skilled to actively make changes to it.  
I'm contributing to linux by creating some of trivial patches and review/testing other's patches.
