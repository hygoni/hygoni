I love Linux and FOSS.  

Currently I'm working for Korean Airforce (~ til 2023.03.13)  
And plan to graduate school in 2025.02  

Topics that I'm interested in:  
  - Linux
    - BPF/Perf (System Performance Analysis)
    - Memory Management Subsystem
    - SL[AUO]B allocators
  - Computer Architecture
  - Algorithm

## Mottos
- Read a lot, think a lot
- Learn from others
- Start small
- Be good to others and myself

## Project started recently
I started two projects recently. Both are not pratical but educational.  

[Designing microprocessor using Verilog](https://github.com/hygoni/mips-microprocessor-design)  
[Writing book about Linux Memory Management Subsystem](https://github.com/hygoni/inside-linux-mm)  

## My contributions to linux kernel
[See on linux-next](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=42.hyeyoo%40gmail.com)

I like working with the community. I'm not yet fully skilled to actively make changes to it.  
I'm contributing to linux by creating some of trivial patches and review/testing other's patches.
