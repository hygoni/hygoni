## My contributions to linux kernel
[See on linux-next](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=42.hyeyoo%40gmail.com)

My primary role is to review and test slab patches.  
Sometimes I also develop new features based on ideas I come up with while reviewing code or attending to conf sessions.
